Title: Anakin's Monday Memo
Date: September 20, 2023
Transcript: "Hey, it's me, Anakin. So, I've gotta remember to work on the pod after school. The left thruster's acting up again, and if I'm gonna race in Boonta Eve, it needs to be in top shape. Oh, and C3PO's wiring's all jumbled again, probably because I took some parts for the pod. Gotta fix him too. Man, he's surprisingly fragile for a droid! And lastly, ugh, Greedo. He keeps bugging me about the credits I owe him. I mean, who does he think he is? I beat him fair and square in that dice game last week. He's so annoying. Alright, memo over. Tomorrow's gonna be a busy day."
